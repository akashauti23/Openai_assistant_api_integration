# Openai_assistant_api_integration

## Hello there 👋🏻,

The utils file in the folder has the essential functions need to run the client without any problem.
and the main contains the streamlit code including the needed pipe.

### To run the API
you'll have to create the .env file in the directory and save the openapi_key in the environment file.

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY = your_openai_api_key
```

after this the openai api key will be provided to client.
after that we can directly initiate streamlit.
for that you'll have to put the below command in terminal.

```sh
streamlit run main.py
```

This will be all to host the streamlit locally

## Thank you..👋🏻
